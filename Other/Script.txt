Have you ever wondered, what el ninio is? We neither!
But some fishermen from Peru did when they noticed that there were fewer fish in the water and the temperature was higher than usual. They were affected economically by that phenomenon. The word El Ninio is Spanish and means the child or in that case Christ's child. The reason why the fishermen named it that way is that this phenomenon reaches its peak around the Christmas period and that's when they noticed it for the first time.
El Ninio occurs irregularly every 2-7 years.
But what is El Ninio exactly and how does it happen?
Under normal conditions, the trade winds travel from east to west but under the occurrence of El Ninio, they weaken or even change direction. Those Trade winds influence sea currents in the Pacific Ocean and bring warm water to East Asia and Oceania. When they weaken or even change direction the sea currents flow in the opposite direction, towards the two Americas. Now the temperatures in Asia cool down while the temperatures in America rise.
La Ninia is the exact opposite of El Ninio. during La Ninia the trade winds intensify and more warm water flows to east Asia and Oceania. The Temperatures there rise while the temperatures in North and South America cool down.
