What is El Niño ?

El Niño is a climate phenomenon associated with warm ocean waters in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. It is part of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which affects global temperature and rainfall patterns. During El Niño, high air pressure occurs in the western Pacific and low air pressure in the eastern Pacific. This disruption in atmospheric and oceanic circulation leads to various impacts, including altered weather patterns, such as droughts, floods, and storms, and ecological changes in marine ecosystems. The El Niño phase typically lasts around four years but can range from two to seven years. It has significant implications for agriculture, fishing, and economies, particularly in countries along the Pacific Ocean. The term "El Niño" originated from Peruvian fishermen who named the weather phenomenon after the newborn Christ, as the warm pool of water near South America is often at its warmest around Christmas.


Consequences:

- Changes in global weather patterns
- Increased rainfall in some regions
- Droughts in other regions
- Disruption of ocean currents
- Impact on marine ecosystems
- Shifts in fish populations
- Changes in agricultural productivity
- Economic impacts on affected countries
- Altered hurricane and typhoon activity
- Influence on global temperature patterns


When does Le Niño happen?

el niño events occur irregularly every 2-7 years and typically last around 9-12 months.

El Niño and trade winds:
During El Niño, the trade winds weaken or even reverse direction due to the changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in the tropical Pacific Ocean.


How did it got discovered ?

el niño was first noticed by Peruvian fishermen who observed warmer waters and changes in fish populations around Christmas time, which led to the name "El Niño" meaning "the Christ child" in Spanish.

General summary:

el niño is a climate phenomenon with warm ocean waters in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific, causing altered weather patterns globally, such as droughts, floods, and storms.
